# Algorithms for determining predicates on polynomial degrees of Boolean functions
Welcome!
This github repository hosts the code used as well as the data generated following my research entitled as seen above.

The folder "code" contains both Python source code "algorithms_for_predicates_source.py" that implements the algorithms as described in the paper and C++ source used to generate all inequivalent Boolean functions of 5 variables "inequivalent_source.cpp".

The files "data/inequivalent/inequivalent_i" for i in range 0 to 16 contains all the possible inequivalent Boolean functions that give value 1 for i different sequences of arguments.

The files "data/degree/degree_i" for i in range 0 to 5 contains all the possible inequivalent Boolean functions of degree i.
